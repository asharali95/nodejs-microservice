In this structure, each service has its own folder that contains a config folder for environment configurations, a src folder for source code, and a package.json file for dependencies.

The auth-service folder contains the authentication service code, with the standard models, controllers, middlewares, and routes folders.

The api-gateway folder contains the API Gateway code, with the middleware folder containing the circuitBreaker.js file for implementing the circuit breaker pattern, and the logging.js file for logging.

The service-registry and service-discovery folders contain code for service registry and service discovery, respectively.

The shared folder contains code and configuration that is shared across all services, such as a logger.js file for logging. This folder also has its own config folder for environment configurations.

The docker-compose.yml file is used to orchestrate the services and their dependencies.

The top-level package.json file lists the dependencies for the entire microservice architecture.
